          <h2>What is a hybrid application?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong
              >One solution to this problem is creating a hybrid
              application</strong
            >. The basis of such an application is a web app that can be made
            using any front-end libraries (e.g., ReactJS, Angular or JQuery).
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step is building a mobile application using the Apache
            Cordova framework, which places the ready application in WebView ( a
            native component on iOS/Android for displaying websites). Cordova
            also provides solutions that allow hybrid applications to use native
            functionalities such as Bluetooth, geolocation and battery.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach allows creating one application (one code used on each
            platform) without using the native programming language of a given
            platform and maintaining consistency between the platforms. What’s
            more, we can also use such an app as a web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hybrid solution is not without its <strong>drawbacks:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When programming a hybrid application, we need to spend more time
              creating a user experience compatible with the native application
              (which is often difficult and boils down to imitating the native
              impressions).
            </li>
            <li>
              Another downside is the application’s performance, which relies on
              a web rendering engine that can become an application bottleneck.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is also worth noting that, because a hybrid application
              operates as a web application, you might see problems typical for
              such applications (the reason behind this is the inconsistency in
              the operation of individual rendering engines on each platform).
