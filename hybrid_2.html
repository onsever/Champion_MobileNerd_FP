          <h2>How does React Native work?</h2>
          <p>
            React Native’s main task is to provide components, which are then
            translated (mapped) to their native equivalents on a given platform.
            This is how it maintains the UX of a given platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, the framework has its own special components (e.g.,
            Button, Modal, Text Input) from which we build the UI. Thanks to
            this, React Native knows how to build an application for a specific
            platform. For example, when creating an Android application, React
            Native translates its Button component into a native button
            available in Android. This architecture also allows developers to
            easily add additional platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second important thing to mention here is the need to
            communicate between the JavaScript world (where our application code
            exists) and the native environment of the platform in which the
            application is displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the code in React Native needs to know when the user
            has pressed a button, typed text into a text field, or switched to
            another view to react to it accordingly. The task of the built-in
            mechanism in React Native Bridge is to ensure communication
            understandable for both environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the downside of this solution is the additional time
            associated with communication between platforms during the
            application’s operation, which must be taken into account – for
            instance, when creating efficient animations in React Native.
