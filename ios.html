            <h2>What is iOS and iOS app development?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>iOS (formerly iPhone OS) </strong> is a mobile operating
              system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its
              hardware. It is the operating system that powers many of the
              company's mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPod Touch; the
              term also included the versions running on iPads until the name
              iPadOS was introduced with version 13 in 2019. It is the world's
              second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after
              Android. It is the basis for three other operating systems made by
              Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It is proprietary software,
              although some parts of it are open source under the Apple Public
              Source License and other licenses.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>iOS application development</strong> is the process of
              making mobile applications for Apple hardware, including the
              iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. In this most fundamental sense, it
              has a lot in common with other types of software or app
              development, but there are a few key differences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the smartphone OS market is dominated by two major
              players—Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. While Android is
              open-source, iOS is used exclusively on Apple hardware. This
              results in another major difference between iOS development and
              the development of other types of software: iOS Developers rely on
              two programming languages,
              <b><a href="swift.html">Swift</a></b> and
              <b><a href="objc.html">Objective-C</a></b> , which are seldom used
              outside the Apple ecosystem. While Objective-C can trace its
              lineage back to the early 80s and is part of the same family of
              languages as C and C++, Swift was developed by Apple specifically
              for iOS and is a more recent invention, first released in 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the things that distinguish mobile app development from
              most other software is that, because apps are designed to run on
              mobile devices with more limited power, they rely on a network
              connection to take advantage of remote computing resources. To
              give one example: there are translation programs you can load onto
              a desktop computer and run locally, including their massive
              databases. By contrast, in a translation program written for iOS
              or another mobile platform, the installable software bundle—the
              app that lives on our phone—exists primarily to create a
              touchpoint for the user to interface with; the app sends a query
              to a remote platform that performs the actual translation, and the
              result is relayed back to the app for the user to read.
            </p>

            <p>
              This client-server model allows the app to take up much less of a
              device’s memory and offers a more streamlined installation and
              operating experience, but adds a layer of complexity as compared
              to software that runs locally—now, the app is required to
              communicate with a network of remote actors. Not all iOS apps
              require a mobile connection to function, but all mobile apps need
              a connection to install and update, an issue the iOS Developer has
              to take into consideration.
