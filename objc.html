            <h2>What is Objective-C Programming Language?</h2>
            <p>
              Objective-C programming is a programming language that is used for
              general-purpose activities. While it is not specific to any
              particular platform or system, it can greatly aid in developing a
              variety of other frameworks. Objective-C programming adds
              messaging capabilities to the programming language C.
            </p>

            <p>
              Objective-C is one of the main programming languages used by Apple
              for the iOS system and can be used to create mobile applications
              for this specific platform. As a superset of the C programming
              language, it offers the ability for developers to be more
              detail-oriented as well as more supportive of objects and other
              languages.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are varied programming languages. At present, three
              programming languages are in great demand, i.e., Swift, Objective
              C, and C++. Let’s see some of the basic differences between
              Objective-C and the other 2 languages:
            </p>

            <p>
              Objective-C is great for memory management; there are compilers
              available that can convert Objective-C code into static code
              analysis, which the language will then use to sort useful
              information and “garbage” into two separate categories.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most important thing about Objective-C to know is that it is
              heavily object-oriented. You can move graphs and manipulate files
              using this supplementary language, but it is important to
              understand its limitations just as much as it is important to
              understand its advantages.
            </p>

            <strong>Difference between Objective-C and Swift:</strong>
            <p>
              Swift is the programming language that was first launched by Apple
              in June 2014. Objective-C yields all warts you’d expect from a
              language formed on C. To distinguish keywords and types from C
              types, Objective-C preceded new keywords by applying the @ symbol.
              Because Swift isn’t made on C, it can ally all the keywords and
              extract the numerous @ symbols in the presence of every
              Objective-C type or object-related keyword.
            </p>

            <p>
              Swift code almost mirrors natural English, in addition to other
              contemporary programming languages. This readability makes it
              simpler for existing programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python,
              C#, and C++ to embrace Swift into their toolchain—unlike the
              unpleasant experience that programmers had to face using
              Objective-C.
            </p>

            <h3>Advantages & Disadvantages of Objective C:</h3>

            <p>Advantages:</p>
            <p>1.Interoperability with C++ and Objective C++</p>
            <p>2.Effective characteristics like method swizzling</p>
            <p>3.More reliable support for coding Binary Frameworks.</p>
            <p>Disadvantages:</p>
            <p>
              1.Since Objective-C is formed on top of C, it needs namespacing.
              All classes in an Objective-C application should be unique
              worldwide. So to dodge contention, there is a practice of
              prefixing the names of classes. This is the purpose we own the
              ‘NS’ prefix for the class in the Foundation Framework and the ‘UI’
              prefix for the classes in UIKit.
            </p>
            <p>2.Specific pointers.</p>
            <p>
              3.The capability to send a message on a nil object without
              dropping and the absence of strict typing lead to bugs that are
              difficult to track and fix.
            </p>
            <p>4.The language is syntactically tedious and complicated.</p>
