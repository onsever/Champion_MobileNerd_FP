            <h2>What is Swift Programming Language?</h2>
            <p>
              Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming
              language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community.
              First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for
              Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C
              had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern
              language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
              frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to
              interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code
              developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is
              built with the open-source LLVM compiler framework and has been
              included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple
              platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows
              C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.
            </p>

            <p>
              Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with
              Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding,
              extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way,
              making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features
              addressing some common programming errors like null pointer
              dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the
              pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol
              extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to
              types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change
              in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented
              programming".
            </p>
            <p>
              Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers
              Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during
              2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially, a
              proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software
              under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's
              platforms and Linux.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant
              evolution, with the core team making source stability a focus in
              later versions. In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed
              Objective-C in measured popularity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some
              built-in classes and structures. Code written with previous
              versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality
              built into Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a
              stable binary interface on Apple platforms, allowing the Swift
              runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is
              source compatible with Swift 4.
            </p>

            <p>
              Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1
              builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable
              features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of
              module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it
              possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with
              future releases of Swift.
            </p>

            <p>
              Swift 5.5, officially announced by Apple at the 2021 WWDC,
              significantly expands language support for concurrency and
              asynchronous code, notably introducing a unique version of the
              actor model.
            </p>

            <strong>Features:</strong>
            <p>
              Swift is an alternative to the Objective-C language that employs
              modern programming-language theory concepts and strives to present
              a simpler syntax. During its introduction, it was described simply
              as "Objective-C without the baggage of C".
            </p>

            <p>
              By default, Swift does not expose pointers and other unsafe
              accessors, in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers
              pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use
              of a Smalltalk-like syntax for making method calls has been
              replaced with a dot-notation style and namespace system more
              familiar to programmers from other common object-oriented (OO)
              languages like Java or C#. Swift introduces true named parameters
              and retains key Objective-C concepts, including protocols,
              closures and categories, often replacing former syntax with
              cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to
              other language structures, like enumerated types (enums).
